# KeelPlugins

Various plugins for Illusion's Unity games like Koikatu, Honey Select, PlayHome and AI Syoujyo.  
Not all of these plugins exist or are even possible to make for all of the games.  
Configuration Manager is recommended to make changing the numerous settings from these plugins easier.

## How to install
1. Install the latest build of [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)
2. Download the latest release for your game from [the releases page](../../releases)
3. Put the dll files you want in the `bepinex/plugins` folder

## Plugin descriptions

#### AltAutoMode
An alternative auto mode for H scenes.  
Edits the full auto mode so you can control the speed of the animation but not the pose.
There is also some added randomization to make the pose changing feel more natural.

#### AnimeAssAssistant
An assistant to help you manage your huge card collections.  
It provides a few shortcuts in maker that let you go through your cards quickly while deciding which cards to keep.  
Enable the plugin in the maker sidebar for the hotkeys to work.

#### CharaStateX
Allows editing the state of multiple studio characters simultaneously.  
Normally only a few parameters such as animation speed/pattern can be edited for multiple characters at once,
but with this you can very easily load poses, change blinking state, switch animation, change clothing state, correct joints and so on.

Another feature in this plugin is H animation matching.  
By selecting a male and a female, and then clicking on an H anim in the list while holding the ctrl key, the plugin will automatically choose the right H animation based on their sex.

#### DefaultParamEditor
Allows editing default settings for character/scene parameters such as eye blinking or shadow density.  
This only affects parameters that make sense to be saved.

To use, set your preferred settings normally and then save them with the new buttons in the studio menus.  
Now when loading a character or starting the studio these settings will be used.

#### GraphicsSettings
Exposes the game's graphics settings and some other values for editing.  
The default settings on the plugin may be too heavy for some computers so remember to tweak them.

#### ItemLayerEdit
Adds a hotkey that switches the currently selected objects layer between the character layer and the map layer.  
This allows for more in-depth editing of lighting in studio.

#### LightManager
Make studio spotlights automatically track characters.  
First select the lights you want to edit then add the character you want to track to the selection and hit apply in the light settings. You cannot select a character first because the light menu has to be open to edit the settings.

#### LockOnPlugin
A camera helper plugin that lets you forget the annoying camera controls and keeps the action right where it needs to be.  
Select a character and press the hotkey to automatically keep the camera focus on the character.

#### MakerBridge
Press the hotkey to send the selected character from maker to studio and vice versa.  
To put it plainly, a temporary character card is created by the sending program which is then loaded by the receiving program when it is detected.

#### TitleShortcuts
Title menu keyboard shortcuts to open different modes.  
For example, press F to open the female editor.  
Also has a setting and commandline arguments to start certain modes automatically during startup.  
Hold esc just before the title screen to cancel automatic startup.  

Koikatu accepts arguments `-femalemaker, -malemaker, -freeh, -live`.  
Honey Select and AI Girl accept arguments `-femalemaker, -malemaker`.

#### RealPOV
First person mode for H scenes.

#### StudioAddonLite
A lite version of the StudioAddon for HS.  
Currently only has the object manipulation hotkeys for studio.
